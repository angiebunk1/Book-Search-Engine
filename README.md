# Book Search Engine

## Description

This is a MERN stack application where users can create accounts, peruse images of books, and add books they are interested in to a saved books list.

At the moment, this application is not functional. It started as a RESTful API and is in the process of being refactored into a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

For the most part, the backend code is refactored and ready for deployment. However, the front-end code is not refactored successfully for deployment.

A Heroku repository was created for this application. If it were to finish being refactored and deployed, it would be found at this url: https://ancient-atoll-23071.herokuapp.com/

## Usage

Since this application is not yet successfully deployed, it is not available to users. If it were deployed users would be able to create accounts, login to their accounts, and add and remove books from their list.
